## Before the workshop

To get the most out of the workshop, we ask that you install git and create an
account on GitHub before starting :)

### Installing Git

Instructions for installing Git for your platform:

#### Ubuntu Linux

For Ubuntu Linux, open your terminal and type:
```
    sudo apt-get install -y git
```
then press the enter key.

To check it's installed correctly, type `git --version` and press enter again.
You should see something similar to this: (Don't worry if the version number
isn't the same)
```
git version 2.24.0
```

### Windows

Go to this page and download the Windows installer: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Run the installer with all the default settings selected.

When complete, check that everything's installed correctly by opening your start
menu and searching for `Git bash`. When you open git bash, you should see a
terminal window. In the terminal, type `git --version` and press enter.

You should see something similar to this: (Don't worry if the version number
isn't the same)
```
git version 2.24.0
```

#### Mac
